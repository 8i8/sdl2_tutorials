/*
 * At the top of our source file we include SDL since we're going to need the
 * SDL functions and datatypes to make any SDL code. We're also going to
 * include C standard IO to print errors to the console. You're probably more
 * used to using iostream, but I use printf in my applications because it's
 * more thread safe. For these early applications, use what ever you are most
 * comfortable with.
 *
 * After including our headers, we declare the width and height of the window
 * we're going to render to.
 */
/*
 * Here's the top of our main function. It's important that we have the
 * arguments of the function be an integer followed by a char* array and the
 * return type be an integer. Any other type of main function will cause an
 * undefined reference to main. SDL requires this type of main so it is
 * compatible with multiple platforms.
 *
 * We then declare our SDL window which we will be creating in a little bit.
 * Following that we have a screen SDL surface. A SDL surface is just a 2D
 * image. A 2D image can be loaded from a file or it can be the image inside of
 * a window. In this case it will be the image we see inside of the window on
 * the screen.
 *
 * After declaring our window and screen surface, we initialize SDL. You can't
 * call any SDL functions without initializing SDL first. Since all we care
 * about is using SDL's video subsystem, we will only be passing it the
 * SDL_INIT_VIDEO flag.
 *
 * When there's an error, SDL_Init returns -1. When there's an error we want to
 * print to the console what happened, other wise the application will just
 * flash for a second and then go away.
 *
 * If you have never used printf before, it stands for print format. It prints
 * the string in the first argument with the variables in the following
 * arguments. When there's an error here, "SDL could not initialize! SDL_Error:
 * " will be written to the console followed by the string returned by
 * SDL_GetError. That %s is special formatting. %s means output a string from
 * our variable list. Since SDL_GetError is the only argument, the string it
 * returns will be added. SDL_GetError returns the latest error produced by an
 * SDL function.
 *
 * SDL_GetError is a very useful function. Whenever something goes wrong you
 * need to know why. SDL_GetError will let you know if any errors happened
 * inside of any SDL function.
 */
/*
 * If SDL initialized successfully, we'll want to create a window using
 * SDL_CreateWindow. The first argument sets the window's caption or this part
 * of the window:
 *
 * The next two arguments define the x and y position the window is created in.
 * Since we don't care where it is created, we just put SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED
 * for the x and y position.
 *
 * The next two arguments define the window's width and height. The last
 * argument are the creation flags. SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN makes sure the window is
 * shown when it is created.
 *
 * If there is an error, SDL_CreateWindow returns NULL. If there's no window,
 * we want to print out the error to the console.
 */
/*
 * If the window was created successfully, we want to get the window's surface
 * so we can draw to it. SDL_GetWindowSurface does just this.
 *
 * To keep this tutorial simple, all we're going to do here is fill the
 * window's surface white using SDL_FillRect. Don't worry too much about this
 * function here. This tutorial is only concerned about getting a window to pop
 * up.
 *
 * An important thing to know about rendering is that just because you've drawn
 * something to the screen surface doesn't mean you'll see it. After you've
 * done all your drawing you need to update the window so it shows everything
 * you drew. A call to SDL_UpdateWindowSurface will do this.
 *
 * If all we do is create the window, fill it, and update it, all we're going
 * to see is a window flash for a second and then close. To keep it from
 * disappearing, we'll call SDL_Delay. SDL_Delay will wait for a given amount
 * of milliseconds. A millisecond is 1/1000 of a second.  This means the code
 * above will make the window wait for 2000 1/1000 of a second or 2 seconds.
 *
 * An important thing to note is that when SDL is delaying, it cannot accept
 * input from the keyboard or mouse. Don't panic when you run this program and
 * it doesn't respond. We haven't given it the code to handle the mouse and
 * keyboard.
 */
/*
 * After the window has delayed there for 2 seconds, we'll destroy the window
 * to free its memory. This will also take care of the SDL_Surface we got from
 * it. After everything is deallocated, we quit SDL and return 0 to terminate
 * the program.
